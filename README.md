# UICLED
#### THE INTELLEGENT LED ADJUSTMENT SOLUTION
### BY UNITED INTERGALACTIC
It is the BASIC VERSION of UICLED.  
Hardware: Using an Arduino Nano as MCU, which drives two BP1808 with PWM as output. Everythin is controlled by an EC11 rotary encoder.  
As my first "mature" work, the PCB is not well organized. EMC is not good.  
Maximum Current: 300mA(Adjustable)
Maximum Output Voltage: 36W
The next version will use STM32F4 or ESP32 series which will provide more possibility to promote its intellegence. Still developing.
